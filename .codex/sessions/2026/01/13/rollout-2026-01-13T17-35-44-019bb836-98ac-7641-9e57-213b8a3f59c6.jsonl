This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"51dc5e8ea62ed07a7cc0c2cee149132f99790a29","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github-rps2305:rps2305/erikleuning-codex.git"}}}

De site draait op gewone HTML-bestanden met een vooraf gecompileerde Tailwind-stylesheet en een klein Alpine.js-script voor de navigatie, thematoggle en cookie-banner.\n\n## Structuur\n\n- `index.html` – hoofdpagina met alle secties.\n- `privacyverklaring.html` – privacy- en disclaimerpagina.\n- `assets/css/main.css` – samengevoegde Tailwind + maatwerk CSS (geen buildstap nodig).\n- `assets/js/main.js` – Alpine.js initialisatie en hulpfuncties.\n- `images/`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` – statische assets.\n- Favicons in de root (`android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `favicon.ico`, `site.webmanifest`) – gegenereerd uit dezelfde logo-bron.\n\n## Aanpassen\n\nJe kunt de bestanden rechtstreeks in een editor aanpassen en vervolgens `index.html` of `privacyverklaring.html` in de browser openen. Eventuele stijlwijzigingen voer je door in `assets/css/main.css` (of door nieuwe Tailwind utility‑klassen toe te voegen in de HTML). De interactiviteit zit in `assets/js/main.js`; Alpine.js wordt via een CDN geladen.\n\n## Favicons\n\nDe favicon-set is gegenereerd uit `images/logo256x256-256.webp`.

Progressive enhancement: Core navigation + content must work with CSS/JS disabled; enhancements must not block reading/contacting. Single source of truth: Content structure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) must be defined once and reused across templates. Deterministic UX: No layout shifts after initial render (CLS control), predictable focus order, consistent spacing. Security & privacy (non-negotiable) No hardcoded secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form + contact hardening: Input validation on server; rate-limit any form endpoints; spam protection without dark patterns. CORS is explicit: If any API exists, Access-Control-Allow-Origin must list exact origins including scheme + domain + port (no * in production). Preflight (OPTIONS) behavior must be supported and tested. Cookie consent: Default to functional-only unless explicit opt-in is collected; “Reject” must be as easy as “Accept”.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Mobile-First, Content-First\n+Layouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\n+structure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\n+across templates to avoid drift.\n+\n+### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\n+Core navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\n+not block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n+\n+### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\n+No layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\n+spacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n+\n+### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\n+No secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\n+input server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\n+CORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\n+preflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\n+is as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\n+plaintext.\n+\n+### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\n+Environment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\n+from config, with a documented `.env.example`. Builds MUST be reproducible with\n+pinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path MUST be documented.\n+Accessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n+\n+## Operational Standards\n+\n+- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n+- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n+- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n+- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n+  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n+- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n+\n+## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n+\n+- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n+  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n+- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n+- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n+- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n+\n+## Governance\n+\n+- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n+- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n+- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n+  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n+- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n*** End Patch"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons.

Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile).

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible).

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\\\"\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\\n\\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\\nshares the link with colleagues.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\\n\\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\\nreader in a desktop browser.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\\n- JS fails;

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid horizontal scrolling and overlapping elements at\n  320px to 430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences with minimal retention.\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n- **NFR-007**: Environment-specific values come from config and `.env.example` is updated.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added; contact is via mailto and tel links only.\n- Active section highlight is a nice-to-have; if implemented it must not break\n  accessibility or keyboard navigation.\n- Structured data markup is optional and can be skipped if it adds risk or complexity.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users on a 320px viewport can reach the Contact section without\n  horizontal scrolling or overlapping content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of header and footer navigation links resolve to valid targets.\n- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can reach Contact in under 15 Tab presses from\n  page load.\n- **SC-004**: Core content remains readable with images disabled and with 200% text\n  zoom enabled.\n- **SC-005**: Mobile performance meets LCP <= 2.5s and CLS <= 0.1 in lab testing.\n"}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow).

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-01-13\n\n- Q: Include a contact form? → A: Mailto + tel links only (no contact form).\n- Q: Cookie consent preference granularity? → A: Manage preferences with analytics vs essential toggle.\n- Q: Canonical URL target? → A: Use current host (dynamic per environment).\n- Q: JS-disabled navigation fallback? → A: Keep hamburger, add a visible fallback link list in main content.\n- Q: Section anchor naming? → A: Use anchors: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij, #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-001a**: Section anchors MUST be named: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij,\n  #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-003a**: With JS disabled, a visible fallback list of navigation links MUST\n  be available in the main content area.\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid horizontal scrolling and overlapping elements at\n  320px to 430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-010a**: The site MUST not include a contact form; contact is via mailto and\n  tel links only.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences with minimal retention.\n- **FR-011a**: Consent management MUST allow users to toggle analytics vs essential\n  cookies only (no finer-grained categories).\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-012a**: Canonical URL MUST use the current host (environment-specific).\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n- **NFR-007**: Environment-specific values come from config and `.env.example` is updated.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added;

Mobile-First, Content-First\nLayouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\nstructure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\nacross templates to avoid drift.\n\n### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\nCore navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\nnot block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n\n### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\nNo layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\nspacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n\n### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\nNo secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\ninput server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\nCORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\npreflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\nis as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\nplaintext.\n\n### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\nEnvironment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\nfrom config, with a documented `.env.example`. Builds MUST be reproducible with\npinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path MUST be documented.\nAccessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n\n## Operational Standards\n\n- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n\n## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n\n- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-01-13\n\n- Q: Include a contact form? → A: Mailto + tel links only (no contact form).\n- Q: Cookie consent preference granularity? → A: Manage preferences with analytics vs essential toggle.\n- Q: Canonical URL target? → A: Use current host (dynamic per environment).\n- Q: JS-disabled navigation fallback? → A: Keep hamburger, add a visible fallback link list in main content.\n- Q: Section anchor naming? → A: Use anchors: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij, #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-001a**: Section anchors MUST be named: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij,\n  #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-003a**: With JS disabled, a visible fallback list of navigation links MUST\n  be available in the main content area.\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid horizontal scrolling and overlapping elements at\n  320px to 430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-010a**: The site MUST not include a contact form; contact is via mailto and\n  tel links only.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences with minimal retention.\n- **FR-011a**: Consent management MUST allow users to toggle analytics vs essential\n  cookies only (no finer-grained categories).\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-012a**: Canonical URL MUST use the current host (environment-specific).\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n- **NFR-007**: Environment-specific values come from config and `.env.example` is updated.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added; contact is via mailto and tel links only.\n- Active section highlight is a nice-to-have; if implemented it must not break\n  accessibility or keyboard navigation.\n- Structured data markup is optional and can be skipped if it adds risk or complexity.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users on a 320px viewport can reach the Contact section without\n  horizontal scrolling or overlapping content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of header and footer navigation links resolve to valid targets.\n- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can reach Contact in under 15 Tab presses from\n  page load.\n- **SC-004**: Core content remains readable with images disabled and with 200% text\n  zoom enabled.\n- **SC-005**: Mobile performance meets LCP <= 2.5s and CLS <= 0.1 in lab testing.\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n### Parallel Team Strategy\\n\\nWith multiple developers:\\n\\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\\n2. Once Foundational is done:\\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\\n- Commit after each task or logical group\\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex\"}","call_id":"call_EHbiabFgdJspcptdJdth5PgE"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-01-13\n\n- Q: Include a contact form? → A: Mailto + tel links only (no contact form).\n- Q: Cookie consent preference granularity? → A: Manage preferences with analytics vs essential toggle.\n- Q: Canonical URL target? → A: Use current host (dynamic per environment).\n- Q: JS-disabled navigation fallback? → A: Keep hamburger, add a visible fallback link list in main content.\n- Q: Section anchor naming? → A: Use anchors: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij, #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-001a**: Section anchors MUST be named: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij,\n  #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-003a**: With JS disabled, a visible fallback list of navigation links MUST\n  be available in the main content area.\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid horizontal scrolling and overlapping elements at\n  320px to 430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-010a**: The site MUST not include a contact form; contact is via mailto and\n  tel links only.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences with minimal retention.\n- **FR-011a**: Consent management MUST allow users to toggle analytics vs essential\n  cookies only (no finer-grained categories).\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-012a**: Canonical URL MUST use the current host (environment-specific).\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n- **NFR-007**: Environment-specific values come from config and `.env.example` is updated.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added; contact is via mailto and tel links only.\n- Active section highlight is a nice-to-have; if implemented it must not break\n  accessibility or keyboard navigation.\n- Structured data markup is optional and can be skipped if it adds risk or complexity.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users on a 320px viewport can reach the Contact section without\n  horizontal scrolling or overlapping content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of header and footer navigation links resolve to valid targets.\n- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can reach Contact in under 15 Tab presses from\n  page load.\n- **SC-004**: Core content remains readable with images disabled and with 200% text\n  zoom enabled.\n- **SC-005**: Mobile performance meets LCP <= 2.5s and CLS <= 0.1 in lab testing.\n"}}

mailto/tel links open.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 1\n\n- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Implement hero wrapper spacing and max-width in index.html\n- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Refactor section card grid for consistent spacing in index.html\n- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Update Contact section links (mailto/tel) and tap targets in index.html\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Fix mobile overflow and spacing issues in assets/css/main.css\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Add responsive image sources and dimensions in index.html and images/\n\n**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 is fully functional and testable independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\n**Goal**: Referrer can quickly scan key sections and share a correctly described page.\n\n**Independent Test**: Headings and anchors are consistent; shared link shows expected title/description.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 2\n\n- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Validate footer quick navigation targets in index.html and privacyverklaring.html\n- [ ] T018 [US2] Add SEO title/description/Open Graph tags in index.html\n- [ ] T019 [US2] Set canonical URL to current host via assets/js/main.js and reference it in index.html and privacyverklaring.html\n- [ ] T020 [US2] Verify section headings and anchor order in index.html\n\n**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 work independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\n**Goal**: Keyboard and screen reader users can navigate landmarks, skip link, menu, and consent without traps.\n\n**Independent Test**: Keyboard-only navigation reaches Contact; skip link is visible and functional; focus is visible.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 3\n\n- [ ] T021 [US3] Implement skip-link focus styles and placement in assets/css/main.css and index.html\n- [ ] T022 [US3] Add keyboard support for mobile menu (Enter/Escape) in assets/js/main.js\n- [ ] T023 [US3] Add cookie banner ARIA labels and focus management in index.html and assets/js/main.js\n- [ ] T024 [US3] Ensure focus-visible styles and contrast updates in assets/css/main.css\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories are independently functional\n\n---\n\n## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories\n\n- [ ] T025 [P] Run viewport matrix audit and update findings in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/bug-list.md\n- [ ] T026 [P] Record accessibility checks in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/accessibility-checklist.md\n- [ ] T027 [P] Capture Lighthouse results in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/performance-report.md\n- [ ] T028 [P] Update quickstart verification steps in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/quickstart.md\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\n\n### Phase Dependencies\n\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)\n  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, verifies SEO/share\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Focused on a11y behavior\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Core markup updates before behavior\n- Styling adjustments before accessibility validation\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- User story tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)\n- Final polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\nTask: \"Implement hero wrapper spacing and max-width in index.html\"\nTask: \"Refactor section card grid for consistent spacing in index.html\"\nTask: \"Update Contact section links (mailto/tel) and tap targets in index.html\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Mobile-First, Content-First\nLayouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\nstructure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\nacross templates to avoid drift.\n\n### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\nCore navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\nnot block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n\n### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\nNo layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\nspacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n\n### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\nNo secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\ninput server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\nCORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\npreflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\nis as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\nplaintext.\n\n### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\nEnvironment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\nfrom config, with a documented `.env.example`. Builds MUST be reproducible with\npinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path MUST be documented.\nAccessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n\n## Operational Standards\n\n- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n\n## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n\n- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n### Parallel Team Strategy\\n\\nWith multiple developers:\\n\\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\\n2.

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-01-13\n\n- Q: Include a contact form? → A: Mailto + tel links only (no contact form).\n- Q: Cookie consent preference granularity? → A: Manage preferences with analytics vs essential toggle.\n- Q: Canonical URL target? → A: Use current host (dynamic per environment).\n- Q: JS-disabled navigation fallback? → A: Keep hamburger, add a visible fallback link list in main content.\n- Q: Section anchor naming? → A: Use anchors: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij, #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-001a**: Section anchors MUST be named: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij,\n  #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-003a**: With JS disabled, a visible fallback list of navigation links MUST\n  be available in the main content area.\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid horizontal scrolling and overlapping elements at\n  320px to 430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-010a**: The site MUST not include a contact form; contact is via mailto and\n  tel links only.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences with minimal retention.\n- **FR-011a**: Consent management MUST allow users to toggle analytics vs essential\n  cookies only (no finer-grained categories).\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-012a**: Canonical URL MUST use the current host (environment-specific).\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added; contact is via mailto and tel links only.\n- Active section highlight is a nice-to-have; if implemented it must not break\n  accessibility or keyboard navigation.\n- Structured data markup is optional and can be skipped if it adds risk or complexity.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users on a 320px viewport can reach the Contact section without\n  horizontal scrolling or overlapping content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of header and footer navigation links resolve to valid targets.\n- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can reach Contact in under 15 Tab presses from\n  page load.\n- **SC-004**: Core content remains readable with images disabled and with 200% text\n  zoom enabled.\n- **SC-005**: Mobile performance meets LCP <= 2.5s and CLS <= 0.1 in lab testing.\n"}}

Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Mobile-First, Content-First\nLayouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\nstructure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\nacross templates to avoid drift.\n\n### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\nCore navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\nnot block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n\n### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\nNo layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\nspacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n\n### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\nNo secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\ninput server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\nCORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\npreflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\nis as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\nplaintext.\n\n### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\nEnvironment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\nfrom config, with a documented `.env.example`. Builds MUST be reproducible with\npinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path MUST be documented.\nAccessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n\n## Operational Standards\n\n- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n\n## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n\n- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n"}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n","images":[]}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-01-13\n\n- Q: Include a contact form? → A: Mailto + tel links only (no contact form).\n- Q: Cookie consent preference granularity? → A: Manage preferences with analytics vs essential toggle.\n- Q: Canonical URL target? → A: Use current host (dynamic per environment).\n- Q: JS-disabled navigation fallback? → A: Keep hamburger, add a visible fallback link list in main content.\n- Q: Section anchor naming? → A: Use anchors: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij, #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-001a**: Section anchors MUST be named: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij,\n  #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-003a**: With JS disabled, a visible fallback list of navigation links MUST\n  be available in the main content area.\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid horizontal scrolling and overlapping elements at\n  320px to 430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-010a**: The site MUST not include a contact form; contact is via mailto and\n  tel links only.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences for 90 days.\n- **FR-011a**: Consent management MUST allow users to toggle analytics vs essential\n  cookies only (no finer-grained categories).\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-012a**: Canonical URL MUST use the current host (environment-specific).\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added; contact is via mailto and tel links only.\n- Active section highlight is a nice-to-have; if implemented it must not break\n  accessibility or keyboard navigation.\n- Structured data markup is optional and can be skipped if it adds risk or complexity.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- Audit bug list with viewport + reproduction steps.\n- IA and content parity inventory between prototype and current site.\n- Viewport/test matrix for 320/360/390/414/768/1024/1440px.\n- Design system reference page (typography, buttons, cards, spacing, cookie states).\n- Accessibility checklist with fixes noted.\n- Performance report with Lighthouse results and CI budget notes.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users on a 320px viewport can reach the Contact section without\n  horizontal scrolling or overlapping content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of header and footer navigation links resolve to valid targets.\n- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can reach Contact in under 15 Tab presses from\n  page load.\n- **SC-004**: Core content remains readable with images disabled and with 200% text\n  zoom enabled.\n- **SC-005**: Mobile performance meets LCP <= 2.5s and CLS <= 0.1 in lab testing.\n"}}

Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Mobile-First, Content-First\nLayouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\nstructure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\nacross templates to avoid drift.\n\n### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\nCore navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\nnot block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n\n### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\nNo layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\nspacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n\n### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\nNo secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\ninput server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\nCORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\npreflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\nis as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\nplaintext.\n\n### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\nEnvironment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\nfrom config, with a documented `.env.example`. If no environment-specific values\nexist (purely static site), `.env.example` is not required. Builds MUST be\nreproducible with pinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path\nMUST be documented. Accessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n\n## Operational Standards\n\n- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n\n## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n\n- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-01-13\n\n- Q: Include a contact form? → A: Mailto + tel links only (no contact form).\n- Q: Cookie consent preference granularity? → A: Manage preferences with analytics vs essential toggle.\n- Q: Canonical URL target? → A: Use current host (dynamic per environment).\n- Q: JS-disabled navigation fallback? → A: Keep hamburger, add a visible fallback link list in main content.\n- Q: Section anchor naming? → A: Use anchors: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij, #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-001a**: Section anchors MUST be named: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij,\n  #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-003a**: With JS disabled, a visible fallback list of navigation links MUST\n  be available in the main content area.\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid overlapping text, images, and buttons at 320px to\n  430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-007a**: Cookie banner MUST apply safe-area insets using `env(safe-area-inset-*)`\n  on iOS devices.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-010a**: The site MUST not include a contact form; contact is via mailto and\n  tel links only.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences for 90 days.\n- **FR-011a**: Consent management MUST allow users to toggle analytics vs essential\n  cookies only (no finer-grained categories).\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-012a**: Canonical URL MUST use the current host (environment-specific).\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added; contact is via mailto and tel links only.\n- Active section highlight is a nice-to-have; if implemented it must not break\n  accessibility or keyboard navigation.\n- Structured data markup is optional and can be skipped if it adds risk or complexity.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- Audit bug list with viewport + reproduction steps.\n- IA and content parity inventory between prototype and current site.\n- Viewport/test matrix for 320/360/390/414/768/1024/1440px.\n- Design system reference page (typography, buttons, cards, spacing, cookie states).\n- Accessibility checklist with fixes noted.\n- Performance report with Lighthouse results and CI budget notes.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users on a 320px viewport can reach the Contact section without\n  horizontal scrolling or overlapping content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of header and footer navigation links resolve to valid targets.\n- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can reach Contact in under 15 Tab presses from\n  page load.\n- **SC-004**: Core content remains readable with images disabled and with 200% text\n  zoom enabled.\n- **SC-005**: Mobile performance meets LCP <= 2.5s and CLS <= 0.1 in lab testing.\n"}}

skip link is visible and functional; focus is visible.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 3\n\n- [ ] T024 [US3] Implement skip-link focus styles and placement in assets/css/main.css and index.html\n- [ ] T025 [US3] Add keyboard support for mobile menu (Enter/Escape) in assets/js/main.js\n- [ ] T026 [US3] Add cookie banner ARIA labels and focus management in index.html and assets/js/main.js\n- [ ] T027 [US3] Ensure focus-visible styles and contrast updates in assets/css/main.css\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories are independently functional\n\n---\n\n## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories\n\n- [ ] T028 [P] Run viewport matrix audit and update findings in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/bug-list.md\n- [ ] T029 [P] Record accessibility checks in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/accessibility-checklist.md\n- [ ] T030 [P] Capture Lighthouse results in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/performance-report.md\n- [ ] T031 [P] Add CI Lighthouse budget enforcement notes in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/performance-report.md\n- [ ] T032 [P] Update quickstart verification steps in specs/001-mobile-site-polish/quickstart.md\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\n\n### Phase Dependencies\n\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)\n  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, verifies SEO/share\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Focused on a11y behavior\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Core markup updates before behavior\n- Styling adjustments before accessibility validation\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- User story tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)\n- Final polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\nTask: \"Implement hero wrapper spacing and max-width in index.html\"\nTask: \"Refactor section card grid for consistent spacing in index.html\"\nTask: \"Update Contact section links (mailto/tel) and tap targets in index.html\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Mobile-First, Content-First\nLayouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\nstructure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\nacross templates to avoid drift.\n\n### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\nCore navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\nnot block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n\n### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\nNo layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\nspacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n\n### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\nNo secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\ninput server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\nCORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\npreflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\nis as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\nplaintext.\n\n### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\nEnvironment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\nfrom config, with a documented `.env.example`. If no environment-specific values\nexist (purely static site), `.env.example` is not required. Builds MUST be\nreproducible with pinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path\nMUST be documented. Accessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n\n## Operational Standards\n\n- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n\n## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n\n- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

The prototype contains “glitches like on mobile” and needs targeted improvements to responsiveness, navigation, accessibility, performance, and overall polish—without losing the existing information architecture and content sections. In-scope pages and content Landing page with sections matching the prototype structure, including: “Welkom bij Erik Leuning” “Begeleiding in beeld” “Over mij” “Doelgroep” “Werkwijze” “Visie” “Werkgebied” “Contact” Footer quick navigation + cookie consent banner Privacyverklaring page must remain present and reachable. Primary user journeys Mobile visitor finds who Erik is + what help he offers, scrolls sections, and can contact via email/phone. Referrer (municipality/organization) validates doelgroep/werkwijze/werkgebied quickly and shares the link. Accessibility user navigates by headings/landmarks and uses skip-link + keyboard to reach Contact. Functional requirements Navigation & information architecture Provide a sticky header navigation (or persistent menu) that: Collapses to a mobile menu at small widths. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape). Highlights active section while scrolling (optional but preferred). All footer “Snelle navigatie” links must point to valid sections/pages. Skip-link (“Overslaan…”) must jump focus to main content and be visible on focus. Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-01-13\n\n- Q: Include a contact form? → A: Mailto + tel links only (no contact form).\n- Q: Cookie consent preference granularity? → A: Manage preferences with analytics vs essential toggle.\n- Q: Canonical URL target? → A: Use current host (dynamic per environment).\n- Q: JS-disabled navigation fallback? → A: Keep hamburger, add a visible fallback link list in main content.\n- Q: Section anchor naming? → A: Use anchors: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij, #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor understands and contacts (Priority: P1)\n\nA mobile visitor lands on the site, quickly understands who Erik is and the help he\nprovides, scrolls through the main sections, and reaches the contact options.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and conversion path for the site.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on a phone-sized viewport by navigating\nthe landing page and activating email or phone contact links.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a 320px wide viewport, **When** the user scrolls through the landing\n   page, **Then** all sections are readable without horizontal scrolling or overlap.\n2. **Given** the Contact section is reached, **When** the user selects email or phone,\n   **Then** a mail client or dialer opens via a real link.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Referrer validates doelgroep and shares (Priority: P2)\n\nA referrer reviews the doelgroep, werkwijze, and werkgebied sections quickly and\nshares the link with colleagues.\n\n**Why this priority**: Referrers are decision-makers and influence referrals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scanning headings and section content and\ncopying the page URL without confusion.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a desktop or tablet viewport, **When** the referrer scans the key\n   sections, **Then** navigation and section headings are clear and consistent.\n2. **Given** the referrer shares the link, **When** the recipient opens it, **Then**\n   the landing page loads with correct title and description metadata.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Accessibility user reaches Contact (Priority: P3)\n\nAn accessibility-focused user navigates by keyboard and headings, uses the skip\nlink, and reaches the Contact section without traps.\n\n**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a requirement and supports all users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested with keyboard-only navigation and a screen\nreader in a desktop browser.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user presses Tab, **Then** the skip link is\n   visible and moves focus to the main content.\n2. **Given** the user navigates by headings and landmarks, **When** moving through\n   the page, **Then** the hierarchy is logical and all sections are reachable.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Very long words or URLs do not overflow or cause horizontal scroll.\n- User increases font size to 200% and layout remains readable.\n- Cookie banner respects safe-area insets and does not block Contact actions.\n- Images or fonts fail to load and content remains readable.\n- JS fails; navigation links remain usable and content remains accessible.\n- Consent storage is blocked; banner defaults to essential-only without looping.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: Site MUST preserve the existing information architecture and section\n  order for the landing page content.\n- **FR-001a**: Section anchors MUST be named: #welkom, #begeleiding, #over-mij,\n  #doelgroep, #werkwijze, #visie, #werkgebied, #contact.\n- **FR-002**: Site MUST provide a sticky header navigation that collapses to a\n  mobile menu at small widths.\n- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be operable by keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape).\n- **FR-003a**: With JS disabled, a visible fallback list of navigation links MUST\n  be available in the main content area.\n- **FR-004**: Footer \"Snelle navigatie\" links MUST resolve to valid sections/pages.\n- **FR-005**: Skip link MUST move focus to main content and be visible on focus.\n- **FR-006**: Layout MUST avoid overlapping text, images, and buttons at 320px to\n  430px widths.\n- **FR-007**: Cookie banner MUST be dismissible and must not permanently cover\n  contact actions; it MUST respect safe-area insets.\n- **FR-007a**: Cookie banner MUST apply safe-area insets using `env(safe-area-inset-*)`\n  on iOS devices.\n- **FR-008**: Images MUST be responsive, include meaningful alt text (or be marked\n  decorative), and avoid layout shifts.\n- **FR-009**: Heading hierarchy MUST use a single H1 with logical H2/H3 nesting and\n  include header/nav/main/footer landmarks.\n- **FR-010**: Contact section MUST include mailto and tel links that are screen-reader\n  friendly.\n- **FR-010a**: The site MUST not include a contact form; contact is via mailto and\n  tel links only.\n- **FR-011**: Cookie consent MUST offer Reject and Accept with equal ease, default\n  to essential-only, and store preferences for 90 days.\n- **FR-011a**: Consent management MUST allow users to toggle analytics vs essential\n  cookies only (no finer-grained categories).\n- **FR-012**: SEO metadata MUST include a page title, description, canonical URL, and\n  Open Graph tags.\n- **FR-012a**: Canonical URL MUST use the current host (environment-specific).\n- **FR-013**: Content MUST be editable without restructuring layout (content changes\n  should not require redesigning sections or navigation).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution)\n\n- **NFR-001**: Layout must be mobile-first (>=320px), no horizontal scrolling.\n- **NFR-002**: Core navigation/content must work without CSS/JS.\n- **NFR-003**: No layout shifts after initial render; consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Content Section**: A named section of the landing page used for navigation anchors.\n- **Navigation Link**: A header or footer link that targets a content section or page.\n- **Consent Choice**: The user's cookie consent state (essential-only, reject, accept).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No contact form backend will be added;

De visie van de instelling sloot niet meer aan bij die van mij en ik kreeg het gevoel dat ik mijn werk niet meer kon uitvoeren zoals ik dat graag zou willen. Bezuinigen en reorganiseren werden toverwoorden; de individuele jongere kwam nadrukkelijk op het tweede plan.</p>\n          <p>Mijn uitgangspunt is dat de cliënt de basis moet zijn van je werkzaamheden en van daaruit moet er een een op maat gemaakt product aangeboden worden om successen te behalen. Ik ben dan ook van mening dat ik, als individuele werker, beter maatwerk kan leveren. Daarom heb ik besloten om een eigen praktijk te beginnen (2015) voor de individuele begeleiding en ondersteuning van mensen die moeite hebben met (bepaalde aspecten van) het dagelijkse leven.</p>\n          <p>In de laatste jaren als pedagogisch medewerker binnen bovengenoemde instelling, heb ik veel specifieke ervaring opgedaan in individuele, gefaseerde zelfstandigheidstraining en ben ervan overtuigd dat ik dit in de persoonlijke begeleiding goed kan vertalen naar een passend plan van aanpak om, in kleine stappen, tot gewenste groei te komen.</p>\n          <p>Inmiddels heb ik een systematiek ontwikkeld, inclusief uitgebreid werkmateriaal, die ik voor meerdere doelgroepen in kan zetten. In 2015 heb ik mij aangesloten bij de coöperatie Zorgondernemers Twente.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"feature-sections\">\n          <section aria-labelledby=\"kwaliteiten-heading\" class=\"feature-panel\">\n            <h2 id=\"kwaliteiten-heading\">Mijn kwaliteiten</h2>\n            <ul class=\"feature-grid\">\n              <li>\n                <h3>Communicatief sterk</h3>\n                <p>Goede communicatieve vaardigheden zorgen voor duidelijke verwachtingen en vertrouwen.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Scherp analyserend</h3>\n                <p>Observeren en analyseren leidt tot maatwerkbegeleiding die aansluit op de hulpvraag.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Brede gedragskennis</h3>\n                <p>Praktijkervaring met uiteenlopende gedragsproblematiek helpt bij het kiezen van passende begeleiding.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Empathisch vermogen</h3>\n                <p>Inlevingsvermogen maakt ruimte voor persoonlijke aandacht en een veilig traject.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Relativerende blik</h3>\n                <p>Relativerend vermogen houdt de begeleiding praktisch, haalbaar en motiverend.</p>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </section>\n          <section aria-labelledby=\"eigenschappen-heading\" class=\"feature-panel\">\n            <h2 id=\"eigenschappen-heading\">Mijn eigenschappen</h2>\n            <ul class=\"feature-grid\">\n              <li>\n                <h3>Geduldig</h3>\n                <p>Geeft cliënten tijd om nieuwe stappen te zetten zonder druk.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Betrokken</h3>\n                <p>Staat naast de cliënt en werkt samen met het netwerk voor duurzame vooruitgang.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Flexibel</h3>\n                <p>Past begeleidingstijden en aanpak aan op wat in de praktijk nodig is.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Stressbestendig</h3>\n                <p>Blijft kalm in complexe situaties en zet door totdat afspraken nagekomen zijn.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <h3>Betrouwbaar</h3>\n                <p>Komt beloften na en zorgt voor heldere communicatie met alle betrokkenen.</p>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n        <article class=\"signature-card\">\n          <h3>Richting &amp; samenwerking</h3>\n          <p>Samen met jou werk ik doelgericht aan zelfstandigheid in het dagelijkse leven.

Van het maken en nakomen van afspraken, tot omgaan met emoties.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6.

Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]}}

Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n","images":[]}}

Mobile-First, Content-First\nLayouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\nstructure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\nacross templates to avoid drift.\n\n### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\nCore navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\nnot block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n\n### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\nNo layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\nspacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n\n### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\nNo secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\ninput server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\nCORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\npreflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\nis as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\nplaintext.\n\n### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\nEnvironment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\nfrom config, with a documented `.env.example`. If no environment-specific values\nexist (purely static site), `.env.example` is not required. Builds MUST be\nreproducible with pinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path\nMUST be documented. Accessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n\n## Operational Standards\n\n- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n\n## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n\n- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

only if tests requested) ⚠️\n\n> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**\n\n- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\n- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\n\n### Implementation for User Story 1\n\n- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\n- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\n- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling\n- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations\n\n**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)\n\n**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]\n\n**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]\n\n### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️\n\n- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\n- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\n\n### Implementation for User Story 2\n\n- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py\n- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py\n- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py\n- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)\n\n**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)\n\n**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]\n\n**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]\n\n### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️\n\n- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\n- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\n\n### Implementation for User Story 3\n\n- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py\n- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py\n- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional\n\n---\n\n[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]\n\n---\n\n## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories\n\n- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/\n- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring\n- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories\n- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/\n- [ ] TXXX Security and privacy hardening (no secrets, PII-safe logging, consent flow)\n- [ ] TXXX Accessibility checks (automated + manual spot checks)\n- [ ] TXXX Performance budget verification (CI or scripted)\n- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\n\n### Phase Dependencies\n\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)\n  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]}}

Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n","images":[]}}

Mobile-First, Content-First\nLayouts MUST render from 320px width upward with no horizontal scrolling. Content\nstructure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) MUST be defined once and reused\nacross templates to avoid drift.\n\n### II. Progressive Enhancement and Resilience\nCore navigation and content MUST work with CSS and JS disabled. Enhancements MUST\nnot block reading or contacting. If images or fonts fail, content remains readable.\n\n### III. Deterministic UX and Stable Layout\nNo layout shifts after initial render (CLS control). Focus order MUST be predictable,\nspacing consistent, and all header/footer links and in-page anchors MUST resolve.\n\n### IV. Security, Privacy, and Consent\nNo secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form endpoints MUST validate\ninput server-side, rate-limit requests, and use spam protection without dark patterns.\nCORS MUST explicitly list allowed origins (scheme + domain + port), with OPTIONS\npreflight supported and tested. Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject\nis as easy as Accept. Never log PII (names, phones, emails, free-text messages) in\nplaintext.\n\n### V. Configuration, Release, and Accessibility Discipline\nEnvironment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) MUST come\nfrom config, with a documented `.env.example`. If no environment-specific values\nexist (purely static site), `.env.example` is not required. Builds MUST be\nreproducible with pinned dependencies and automated lint/format. Rollback path\nMUST be documented. Accessibility checks are part of Definition of Done.\n\n## Operational Standards\n\n- Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints).\n- Server logs are structured, rotated, and least-privilege access only.\n- Performance budgets are enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent).\n- Supported browsers: latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera,\n  plus iOS Safari and Android Chrome.\n- Hosting remains portable (static or server) with no vendor lock-in.\n\n## Quality Gates and Review Workflow\n\n- Every change MUST verify: progressive enhancement, zero broken navigation,\n  deterministic layout, and cookie consent behavior.\n- If APIs exist, CORS and preflight behavior MUST be covered by tests.\n- Accessibility checks and performance budget verification are required gates.\n- Security/privacy requirements are non-negotiable and block release if violated.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other practices.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and migration impact.\n- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance\n  changes or removals, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed in specs, plans, and PRs before merge.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date unknown. | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-13\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"Generate a file named AGENTS.md that serves as a contributor guide for this repository.\nYour goal is to produce a clear, concise, and well-structured document with descriptive headings and actionable explanations for each section.\nFollow the outline below, but adapt as needed — add sections if relevant, and omit those that do not apply to this project.\n\nDocument Requirements\n\n- Title the document \"Repository Guidelines\".\n- Use Markdown headings (#, ##, etc.) for structure.\n- Keep the document concise. 200-400 words is optimal.\n- Keep explanations short, direct, and specific to this repository.\n- Provide examples where helpful (commands, directory paths, naming patterns).\n- Maintain a professional, instructional tone.\n\nRecommended Sections\n\nProject Structure & Module Organization\n\n- Outline the project structure, including where the source code, tests, and assets are located.\n\nBuild, Test, and Development Commands\n\n- List key commands for building, testing, and running locally (e.g., npm test, make build).\n- Briefly explain what each command does.\n\nCoding Style & Naming Conventions\n\n- Specify indentation rules, language-specific style preferences, and naming patterns.\n- Include any formatting or linting tools used.\n\nTesting Guidelines\n\n- Identify testing frameworks and coverage requirements.\n- State test naming conventions and how to run tests.\n\nCommit & Pull Request Guidelines\n\n- Summarize commit message conventions found in the project’s Git history.\n- Outline pull request requirements (descriptions, linked issues, screenshots, etc.).\n\n(Optional) Add other sections if relevant, such as Security & Configuration Tips, Architecture Overview, or Agent-Specific Instructions.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nDesign principles Mobile-first, content-first: All layouts must render correctly from 320px width and up with no horizontal scrolling. Progressive enhancement: Core navigation + content must work with CSS/JS disabled; enhancements must not block reading/contacting. Single source of truth: Content structure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) must be defined once and reused across templates. Deterministic UX: No layout shifts after initial render (CLS control), predictable focus order, consistent spacing. Security & privacy (non-negotiable) No hardcoded secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form + contact hardening: Input validation on server; rate-limit any form endpoints; spam protection without dark patterns. CORS is explicit: If any API exists, Access-Control-Allow-Origin must list exact origins including scheme + domain + port (no * in production). Preflight (OPTIONS) behavior must be supported and tested. Cookie consent: Default to functional-only unless explicit opt-in is collected; “Reject” must be as easy as “Accept”. PII safe logging: Never log names, phone numbers, email addresses, or free-text messages in plaintext. Error handling Zero broken navigation: All header/footer links and in-page anchors must resolve. Graceful failure: If images/fonts fail, content stays readable; if JS fails, navigation remains usable. Accessible error states: Any form errors must be announced to screen readers and placed next to the field. Logging & observability Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints). Server logs: structured, rotated, least-privilege access. Performance budgets enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent). Configuration & secrets management All environment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) come from environment config. Provide .env.example and document required variables. Portability & environment support Must support latest stable versions of: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera. Must work on iOS Safari and Android Chrome at minimum. Hosting must be compatible with the chosen platform (static hosting or server hosting) without vendor lock-in. Build & release guarantees Reproducible builds, pinned dependencies, automated lint + format. Rollback path documented (previous version redeploy). Accessibility checks must be part of Definition of Done.\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nYou are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.\n\nFollow this execution flow:\n\n1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.\n   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.\n   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\n\n2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:\n   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.\n   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).\n   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.\n   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:\n     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.\n     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.\n     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.\n   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.\n\n3. Draft the updated constitution content:\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\n\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\n\n5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):\n   - Version change: old → new\n   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)\n   - Added sections\n   - Removed sections\n   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths\n   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.\n\n6. Validation before final output:\n   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.\n   - Version line matches report.\n   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\n   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language (\"should\" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).\n\n7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).\n\n8. Output a final summary to the user with:\n   - New version and bump rationale.\n   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.\n   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).\n\nFormatting & Style Requirements:\n\n- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).\n- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.\n- Keep a single blank line between sections.\n- Avoid trailing whitespace.\n\nIf the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.\n\nIf critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.\n\nDo not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nProblem statement A new website for Erik Leuning is being built for erikleuning.nl with a prototype currently hosted on GitHub Pages.

Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6.

Capture current IA + content parity between current live site and prototype. Run responsive checks at 320/360/390/414px widths + tablet/desktop breakpoints. Identify top mobile issues (typical culprits to confirm): Overflow caused by fixed widths / long lines / unscaled images Sticky elements (header/cookie banner) covering content Tap targets too small / menu inaccessible Layout shift from images without dimensions Deliverable: “Bug list” with exact viewport + reproduction steps + expected behavior. Phase 2 — Design system + layout refactor (mobile-first) Tech choice: Keep it simple—semantic HTML + modern CSS (Grid/Flex), minimal JS. Implement a small design system page (typography, buttons, cards, spacing, forms, cookie banner states). Define breakpoints and spacing scale (CSS variables). Refactor sections into consistent components: Hero Section wrapper (max-width, padding) Card grid for “kwaliteiten/eigenschappen” Fix images: Add aspect-ratio or width/height Responsive sources and compression Cookie banner: Safe-area aware Focus-managed Not blocking Contact Security controls: No third-party scripts by default. If analytics is needed, add only after consent. Deliverable: Updated prototype with zero horizontal scroll and stable layout. Phase 3 — Accessibility hardening (WCAG 2.1 AA) Landmarks + heading order validation. Keyboard walkthrough for: Skip-link Mobile menu open/close Cookie banner actions Contrast and focus-visible checks. Screen reader spot checks (NVDA/VoiceOver basics). Deliverable: Accessibility checklist + fixes merged. Phase 4 — Performance + SEO Establish performance budgets; add CI Lighthouse run. Optimize fonts (system font stack or self-hosted with preload + font-display: swap). Add SEO tags, Open Graph, sitemap, robots. Deliverable: Lighthouse report meeting budgets + metadata complete. Phase 5 — Production cutover to erikleuning.nl Choose hosting path: Static hosting (preferred if no dynamic backend) Add backend only if contact form requires it Add redirects from old URLs to new anchors/pages as needed. Monitoring: Uptime check Basic error logging (no PII) Rollback plan: Keep previous site deployable and documented; revert DNS/hosting target if needed.

For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n\n   ```text\n   For each unknown in Technical Context:\n     Task: \"Research {unknown} for {feature context}\"\n   For each technology choice:\n     Task: \"Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:\n   - Decision: [what was chosen]\n   - Rationale: [why chosen]\n   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]\n\n**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved\n\n### Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete\n\n1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`\n\n3. **Agent context update**:\n   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`\n   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use\n   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file\n   - Add only new technology from current plan\n   - Preserve manual additions between markers\n\n**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file\n\n## Key rules\n\n- Use absolute paths\n- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Goal\n\nIdentify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation.

If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS.

Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6.

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1.

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):\n   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory\n   - For each checklist, count:\n     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`\n   - Create a status table:\n\n     ```text\n     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |\n     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|\n     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |\n     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     ```\n\n   - Calculate overall status:\n     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items\n     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items\n\n   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:\n     - Display the table with incomplete item counts\n     - **STOP** and ask: \"Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)\"\n     - Wait for user response before continuing\n     - If user says \"no\" or \"wait\" or \"stop\", halt execution\n     - If user says \"yes\" or \"proceed\" or \"continue\", proceed to step 3\n\n   - **If all checklists are complete**:\n     - Display the table showing all checklists passed\n     - Automatically proceed to step 3\n\n3. Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nRemove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"a"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n\n   ```text\n   For each unknown in Technical Context:\n     Task: \"Research {unknown} for {feature context}\"\n   For each technology choice:\n     Task: \"Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:\n   - Decision: [what was chosen]\n   - Rationale: [why chosen]\n   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]\n\n**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved\n\n### Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete\n\n1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`\n\n3. **Agent context update**:\n   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`\n   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use\n   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file\n   - Add only new technology from current plan\n   - Preserve manual additions between markers\n\n**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file\n\n## Key rules\n\n- Use absolute paths\n- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1.

Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nWelkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"a"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n\n   ```text\n   For each unknown in Technical Context:\n     Task: \"Research {unknown} for {feature context}\"\n   For each technology choice:\n     Task: \"Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:\n   - Decision: [what was chosen]\n   - Rationale: [why chosen]\n   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]\n\n**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved\n\n### Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete\n\n1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`\n\n3. **Agent context update**:\n   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`\n   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use\n   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file\n   - Add only new technology from current plan\n   - Preserve manual additions between markers\n\n**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file\n\n## Key rules\n\n- Use absolute paths\n- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):\n   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory\n   - For each checklist, count:\n     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`\n   - Create a status table:\n\n     ```text\n     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |\n     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|\n     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |\n     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     ```\n\n   - Calculate overall status:\n     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items\n     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items\n\n   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:\n     - Display the table with incomplete item counts\n     - **STOP** and ask: \"Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)\"\n     - Wait for user response before continuing\n     - If user says \"no\" or \"wait\" or \"stop\", halt execution\n     - If user says \"yes\" or \"proceed\" or \"continue\", proceed to step 3\n\n   - **If all checklists are complete**:\n     - Display the table showing all checklists passed\n     - Automatically proceed to step 3\n\n3. Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task

Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

(file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `the links in the main menu fail, they must point to the homepage; The main menu and the content still do not have the same width` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6.

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"Generate a file named AGENTS.md that serves as a contributor guide for this repository.\nYour goal is to produce a clear, concise, and well-structured document with descriptive headings and actionable explanations for each section.\nFollow the outline below, but adapt as needed — add sections if relevant, and omit those that do not apply to this project.\n\nDocument Requirements\n\n- Title the document \"Repository Guidelines\".\n- Use Markdown headings (#, ##, etc.) for structure.\n- Keep the document concise. 200-400 words is optimal.\n- Keep explanations short, direct, and specific to this repository.\n- Provide examples where helpful (commands, directory paths, naming patterns).\n- Maintain a professional, instructional tone.\n\nRecommended Sections\n\nProject Structure & Module Organization\n\n- Outline the project structure, including where the source code, tests, and assets are located.\n\nBuild, Test, and Development Commands\n\n- List key commands for building, testing, and running locally (e.g., npm test, make build).\n- Briefly explain what each command does.\n\nCoding Style & Naming Conventions\n\n- Specify indentation rules, language-specific style preferences, and naming patterns.\n- Include any formatting or linting tools used.\n\nTesting Guidelines\n\n- Identify testing frameworks and coverage requirements.\n- State test naming conventions and how to run tests.\n\nCommit & Pull Request Guidelines\n\n- Summarize commit message conventions found in the project’s Git history.\n- Outline pull request requirements (descriptions, linked issues, screenshots, etc.).\n\n(Optional) Add other sections if relevant, such as Security & Configuration Tips, Architecture Overview, or Agent-Specific Instructions.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nDesign principles Mobile-first, content-first: All layouts must render correctly from 320px width and up with no horizontal scrolling. Progressive enhancement: Core navigation + content must work with CSS/JS disabled; enhancements must not block reading/contacting. Single source of truth: Content structure (sections, headings, navigation anchors) must be defined once and reused across templates. Deterministic UX: No layout shifts after initial render (CLS control), predictable focus order, consistent spacing. Security & privacy (non-negotiable) No hardcoded secrets in repo, build artifacts, or client JS. Form + contact hardening: Input validation on server; rate-limit any form endpoints; spam protection without dark patterns. CORS is explicit: If any API exists, Access-Control-Allow-Origin must list exact origins including scheme + domain + port (no * in production). Preflight (OPTIONS) behavior must be supported and tested. Cookie consent: Default to functional-only unless explicit opt-in is collected; “Reject” must be as easy as “Accept”. PII safe logging: Never log names, phone numbers, email addresses, or free-text messages in plaintext. Error handling Zero broken navigation: All header/footer links and in-page anchors must resolve. Graceful failure: If images/fonts fail, content stays readable; if JS fails, navigation remains usable. Accessible error states: Any form errors must be announced to screen readers and placed next to the field. Logging & observability Client telemetry is opt-in and anonymized (no fingerprints). Server logs: structured, rotated, least-privilege access. Performance budgets enforced in CI (Lighthouse or equivalent). Configuration & secrets management All environment-specific values (analytics IDs, API URLs, mail endpoints) come from environment config. Provide .env.example and document required variables. Portability & environment support Must support latest stable versions of: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera. Must work on iOS Safari and Android Chrome at minimum. Hosting must be compatible with the chosen platform (static hosting or server hosting) without vendor lock-in. Build & release guarantees Reproducible builds, pinned dependencies, automated lint + format. Rollback path documented (previous version redeploy). Accessibility checks must be part of Definition of Done.\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nYou are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.\n\nFollow this execution flow:\n\n1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.\n   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.\n   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\n\n2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:\n   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.\n   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).\n   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.\n   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:\n     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.\n     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.\n     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.\n   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.\n\n3. Draft the updated constitution content:\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\n\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\n\n5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):\n   - Version change: old → new\n   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)\n   - Added sections\n   - Removed sections\n   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths\n   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.\n\n6. Validation before final output:\n   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.\n   - Version line matches report.\n   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\n   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language (\"should\" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).\n\n7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).\n\n8. Output a final summary to the user with:\n   - New version and bump rationale.\n   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.\n   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).\n\nFormatting & Style Requirements:\n\n- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).\n- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.\n- Keep a single blank line between sections.\n- Avoid trailing whitespace.\n\nIf the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.\n\nIf critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.\n\nDo not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nProblem statement A new website for Erik Leuning is being built for erikleuning.nl with a prototype currently hosted on GitHub Pages.

Mobile responsiveness (“glitches” acceptance criteria) At widths 320px–430px (common phones): No horizontal scrolling. No overlapping text/images/buttons. No “double-tap to zoom” requirements; ensure viewport/meta and scalable layout. The cookie banner must not cover the Contact actions permanently; it must be dismissible and respect safe-area insets (iOS notch). At widths >=768px (tablet) and >=1024px (desktop): Content uses readable measure (line length), consistent spacing, and balanced columns. Media (images/icons) Images must: Be responsive (srcset/sizes or equivalent). Not cause layout shift (width/height or aspect-ratio defined). Have meaningful alt text (decorative images marked appropriately). Prototype includes multiple “Image:” items that must be handled correctly. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA target) The prototype claims WCAG 2.1 AA alignment; the implementation must meet it in practice: Correct heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting). Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). Focus visible, sufficient contrast, and no keyboard traps. Accessible cookie consent (role/labels, focus management). Contact links (email/phone) are real links and screen-reader friendly. Contact Contact section must include: Email link and phone number link (tap-to-call on mobile). Optional: simple contact form (only if you decide to add backend handling; otherwise keep mailto/tel). If a form is added: Server-side validation + rate limiting + abuse protection. Clear consent/processing notice referencing Privacyverklaring. Cookie consent Provide three states: Reject all non-essential Accept all Manage preferences (optional but preferred) Default must be essential-only; store consent choices with minimal retention. Non-functional requirements Performance budgets Mobile Lighthouse targets (or equivalent): LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile (lab target) CLS <= 0.1 INP “good” range where feasible Total blocking JS must be minimized; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified. SEO & sharing Proper title/description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags. Structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness) optional. Maintainability Content should be editable without touching layout code (e.g., markdown/content files or CMS). Consistent component system (buttons, cards, typographic scale). Explicit security declarations Trust boundaries Browser is untrusted. Any server/API endpoints are trusted only after authn/authz and validation. Third-party embeds/analytics are untrusted and must be isolated. Authentication/authorization Public informational site: no auth required unless an admin/editor area exists (out of scope unless specified later). CORS policy If a backend API is introduced: Access-Control-Allow-Origin must be a strict allowlist, e.g.: https://www.erikleuning.nl (optional staging) https://rps2305.github.io only if needed Include ports explicitly for any non-443 origins (e.g., https://staging.example:8443). Access-Control-Allow-Credentials only if absolutely required; document justification. OPTIONS preflight must return consistent headers and 204/200. Edge cases Very long words/URLs (no overflow). User increases font size to 200% (layout must hold). Dark mode (optional): if supported, must maintain contrast. Offline/slow network: images may not load; still readable. Cookie banner + mobile safe areas + small viewport height. Failure modes & required behaviors Missing image/font: fall back gracefully. JS error: menu still operable (basic links visible). Consent storage blocked: default to essential-only; do not loop banners.\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3.

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5.

Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"a"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"c"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"c"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"b"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"a"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nPhase 1 — Baseline audit (prototype + current site) Goal: Turn “glitches on mobile” into a reproducible checklist. Capture current IA + content parity between current live site and prototype. Run responsive checks at 320/360/390/414px widths + tablet/desktop breakpoints. Identify top mobile issues (typical culprits to confirm): Overflow caused by fixed widths / long lines / unscaled images Sticky elements (header/cookie banner) covering content Tap targets too small / menu inaccessible Layout shift from images without dimensions Deliverable: “Bug list” with exact viewport + reproduction steps + expected behavior. Phase 2 — Design system + layout refactor (mobile-first) Tech choice: Keep it simple—semantic HTML + modern CSS (Grid/Flex), minimal JS. Implement a small design system page (typography, buttons, cards, spacing, forms, cookie banner states). Define breakpoints and spacing scale (CSS variables). Refactor sections into consistent components: Hero Section wrapper (max-width, padding) Card grid for “kwaliteiten/eigenschappen” Fix images: Add aspect-ratio or width/height Responsive sources and compression Cookie banner: Safe-area aware Focus-managed Not blocking Contact Security controls: No third-party scripts by default. If analytics is needed, add only after consent. Deliverable: Updated prototype with zero horizontal scroll and stable layout. Phase 3 — Accessibility hardening (WCAG 2.1 AA) Landmarks + heading order validation. Keyboard walkthrough for: Skip-link Mobile menu open/close Cookie banner actions Contrast and focus-visible checks. Screen reader spot checks (NVDA/VoiceOver basics). Deliverable: Accessibility checklist + fixes merged. Phase 4 — Performance + SEO Establish performance budgets; add CI Lighthouse run. Optimize fonts (system font stack or self-hosted with preload + font-display: swap). Add SEO tags, Open Graph, sitemap, robots. Deliverable: Lighthouse report meeting budgets + metadata complete. Phase 5 — Production cutover to erikleuning.nl Choose hosting path: Static hosting (preferred if no dynamic backend) Add backend only if contact form requires it Add redirects from old URLs to new anchors/pages as needed. Monitoring: Uptime check Basic error logging (no PII) Rollback plan: Keep previous site deployable and documented; revert DNS/hosting target if needed.

For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n\n   ```text\n   For each unknown in Technical Context:\n     Task: \"Research {unknown} for {feature context}\"\n   For each technology choice:\n     Task: \"Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:\n   - Decision: [what was chosen]\n   - Rationale: [why chosen]\n   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]\n\n**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved\n\n### Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete\n\n1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`\n\n3. **Agent context update**:\n   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`\n   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use\n   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file\n   - Add only new technology from current plan\n   - Preserve manual additions between markers\n\n**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file\n\n## Key rules\n\n- Use absolute paths\n- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Goal\n\nIdentify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation.

Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6.

Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):\n   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory\n   - For each checklist, count:\n     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`\n   - Create a status table:\n\n     ```text\n     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |\n     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|\n     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |\n     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     ```\n\n   - Calculate overall status:\n     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items\n     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items\n\n   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:\n     - Display the table with incomplete item counts\n     - **STOP** and ask: \"Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)\"\n     - Wait for user response before continuing\n     - If user says \"no\" or \"wait\" or \"stop\", halt execution\n     - If user says \"yes\" or \"proceed\" or \"continue\", proceed to step 3\n\n   - **If all checklists are complete**:\n     - Display the table showing all checklists passed\n     - Automatically proceed to step 3\n\n3. Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nRemove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Remove link to Privacy from the main menu on the top. Copyright was last year, be sure it is always the current year\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"a"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH.

Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning.

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1.

Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nWelkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Welkom in the main menu must be Home; Be sure the main menu fits in the same width as the content; max-width is about 112-114px, make is 1260px\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"a"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n\n   ```text\n   For each unknown in Technical Context:\n     Task: \"Research {unknown} for {feature context}\"\n   For each technology choice:\n     Task: \"Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:\n   - Decision: [what was chosen]\n   - Rationale: [why chosen]\n   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]\n\n**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved\n\n### Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete\n\n1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`\n\n3. **Agent context update**:\n   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`\n   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use\n   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file\n   - Add only new technology from current plan\n   - Preserve manual additions between markers\n\n**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file\n\n## Key rules\n\n- Use absolute paths\n- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):\n   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory\n   - For each checklist, count:\n     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`\n   - Create a status table:\n\n     ```text\n     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |\n     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|\n     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |\n     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     ```\n\n   - Calculate overall status:\n     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items\n     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items\n\n   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:\n     - Display the table with incomplete item counts\n     - **STOP** and ask: \"Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)\"\n     - Wait for user response before continuing\n     - If user says \"no\" or \"wait\" or \"stop\", halt execution\n     - If user says \"yes\" or \"proceed\" or \"continue\", proceed to step 3\n\n   - **If all checklists are complete**:\n     - Display the table showing all checklists passed\n     - Automatically proceed to step 3\n\n3. Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9.

If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nthe links in the main menu fail, they must point to the homepage; The main menu and the content still do not have the same width\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `the links in the main menu fail, they must point to the homepage; The main menu and the content still do not have the same width` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"the links in the main menu fail, they must point to the homepage; The main menu and the content still do not have the same width\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"the links in the main menu fail, they must point to the homepage; The main menu and the content still do not have the same width\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"the links in the main menu fail, they must point to the homepage; The main menu and the content still do not have the same width\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9.

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\ngo to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"go to the mobile menu if screen is 1366px wide or smaller;\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7.

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

(file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]}}

You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n","images":[]}}

consistent focus order.\n- **NFR-004**: Cookie consent defaults to functional-only; Reject is as easy as Accept.\n- **NFR-005**: If APIs exist, CORS origins are explicit and OPTIONS preflight is supported.\n- **NFR-006**: Performance budgets and accessibility checks are required gates.\n- **NFR-007**: Environment-specific values come from config and `.env.example` is updated.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The production domain is `https://www.erikleuning.nl/`.\n- The privacy page is deployed at `https://www.erikleuning.nl/privacyverklaring.html`.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n<!--\n  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.\n  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.\n-->\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: `htmlhint`, `stylelint`, and `eslint` report zero errors on repo files.\n- **SC-002**: axe-core CLI reports 0 violations for `index.html`,\n`privacyverklaring.html`, and `design-system.html`.\n- **SC-003**: Header container and main content widths match within 1px at 320px,\n768px, 1024px, 1366px, and 1440px viewports.\n- **SC-004**: Canonical/OG/hreflang values resolve to absolute production URLs\nand match sitemap entries.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- Mobile-first layout (>=320px) with no horizontal scrolling. (Validated by lint plan to keep width rules in sync.)  \n- Progressive enhancement: navigation and content degrade gracefully (no-JS links + Alpine guard logic).  \n- Deterministic UX: CSS `--content-max` + focus trapping ensures no layout shifts and predictable focus.  \n- Security/privacy: No embedded secrets, analytics loaded only after consent (per cookie banner logic).  \n- Consent + CORS: Consent flow defaults to essential cookies; no APIs are introduced that would require CORS.  \n- Performance + accessibility: Lints + axe-core CLI run in quickstart; budgets noted in success criteria.  \n- Config discipline: Environment-specific values already stored outside this feature (analytics ID is static, no new secrets).\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/002-quality-a11y-fixes/\n├── plan.md\n├── research.md\n├── data-model.md\n├── quickstart.md\n├── contracts/\n│   └── README.md\n└── tasks.md  # Not generated yet (Phase 2 / speckit.tasks)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nassets/\n├── css/main.css\n├── js/main.js\n├── [existing images/icons]\nindex.html\nprivacyverklaring.html\ndesign-system.html\nrobots.txt\nsitemap.xml\n`\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/ronald/Developer/www/erikleuning-codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
