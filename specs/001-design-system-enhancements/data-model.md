# Data Model: Design System Enhancements

This feature does not introduce persistent data entities. It adds static component examples and styling references only.

- **Component Example**: Represents a static HTML snippet for a UI pattern (no stored attributes).
- **Interaction State**: Visual states (hover/focus/active/disabled) defined in CSS; no persisted state.
