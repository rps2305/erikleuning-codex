# Phase 0 Research: Menu Home Label and Width Alignment

## Decision 1: Home label change
- **Decision**: Replace "Welkom" with "Home" in the main menu label.
- **Rationale**: Aligns navigation wording with user expectation.
- **Alternatives considered**: Keeping "Welkom"; rejected due to explicit request.

## Decision 2: Width alignment
- **Decision**: Set both header and main content max-width to 1260px.
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent alignment across header and content.
- **Alternatives considered**: Only widen header or keep existing widths; rejected
  due to mismatch risk.
