# UX Requirements Checklist: Design System Completion

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of design-system requirements with emphasis on visual examples and states
**Created**: 2026-01-14
**Feature**: `specs/001-design-system-complete/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are button variant requirements complete across primary/secondary/disabled and all interaction states? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 Are link state requirements explicitly defined for default/hover/focus within text contexts? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 Are form requirements complete for inputs, textarea, labels, and error/success states? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK004 Are navigation requirements complete for both header and mobile menu examples? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are list requirements complete for ordered and unordered examples? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 Are card requirements complete for simple, action, and image variants? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK007 Are alert/message requirements complete for success and error variants? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK008 Are footer example requirements explicitly defined as part of the design system coverage? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK009 Is the definition of "visible examples" precise enough to avoid ambiguity about what must be shown? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK010 Are "hover, focus, active, disabled, and error states" defined with clear visual distinctions rather than implied behavior? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK011 Is the location of examples constrained clearly to `design-system.html` without exceptions? [Clarity, Spec §FR-015]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the requirement for visual token examples (color swatches, accent typography) sufficiently specific about scope and placement? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK013 Do component coverage requirements align with the stated independent test for User Story 1? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK014 Are documentation requirements consistent between the main requirement and the clarified file location? [Consistency, Spec §FR-012, Spec §FR-012a]
- [ ] CHK015 Are Tailwind config requirements consistent with the constraint of "no build tooling" in the plan? [Consistency, Spec §FR-013a, Plan §Technical Context]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 Are success criteria measurable for component coverage without relying on subjective interpretation? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria measurable for interaction state coverage across all required states? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK018 Is the documentation success criterion specific enough to confirm all foundational sections are present? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are primary scenarios documented for each required component category (buttons, links, forms, navigation, lists, cards, alerts, footer)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-001–FR-008]
- [ ] CHK020 Are documentation scenarios explicitly covered for spacing, breakpoints, grid/container, icon style, imagery, and tone of voice? [Coverage, Spec §FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are long-label edge cases specified for all components that include text labels (buttons, tabs, navigation)? [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are focus visibility edge cases specified for both light and dark backgrounds? [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK023 Are non-functional requirements relevant to a static design system explicitly acknowledged (mobile-first, progressive enhancement, deterministic layout)? [Coverage, Spec §NFR-001–NFR-003]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK024 Are assumptions about static delivery and no backend explicitly documented and non-conflicting with requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK025 Is the term "static examples" defined clearly enough to avoid interactive behavior expectations? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK026 Are there any conflicts between "examples-only on design-system.html" and documentation linkage requirements? [Conflict, Spec §FR-015, Spec §FR-012a]
